# OAuth 2.0

If you are distributing your app to multiple churches, you should use [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) version 2.0.

First, your company needs to have a Planning Center account, which represents your organization. You can [create one here](https://accounts.planningcenteronline.com/sign_up). This feels a little funny at first, because it is like you are signing up as a church for Planning Center. But having a Planning Center account with a login gives you a place to manage your OAuth application. The name you give your Planning Center account (the "church" name) can just be your company name.

Once you are logged into your Planning Center account, visit [api.planningcenteronline.com](https://api.planningcenteronline.com/) to create an OAuth application. This client ID and secret will only be created once, and will be reused for every church that signs up for your integration.

**Important:** Only create one OAuth application. When using OAuth, churches do **not** need to create their own OAuth application. You can integrate with multiple churches using your single OAuth application that you control.

Starting March 22, 2023, only Organization Administrators can create OAuth applications, and all new applications are managed by all Organization Administrators in your organization. If you are part of a church you should consider [creating a new free organization](https://developer.planning.center/docs/#/overview/authentication/https://www.planningcenter.com/pricing) to hold your application if the application doesn't belong to that church.

Make sure your app conforms to the [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) specification. Generally, to authenticate a user, follow these steps:

1. Redirect the user’s browser to





```
https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=https://example.com/auth/complete&response_type=code&scope=people
```





Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `https://example.com/auth/complete` with your actual redirect URI. If you need different scopes, replace `scope=people` appropriately (see [Application Scopes](https://developer.planning.center/docs/#/overview/authentication/oauth-2-0#scopes)).

2. Planning Center will redirect the user’s browser back to the given redirect URI with a `code` param.

3. Send a POST request in the background to `https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/token` with the following params:





```bash
{
     "grant_type": "authorization_code",
     "code": "CODE_FROM_STEP_2",
     "client_id": "CLIENT_ID",
     "client_secret": "CLIENT_SECRET",
     "redirect_uri": "https://example.com/auth/complete"
}
```





Replace `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `CODE_FROM_STEP_2`, and the redirect URI appropriately.





```bash
curl -X POST https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/token \
     -F grant_type=authorization_code \
     -F code=1234567890 \
     -F client_id=2345678901 \
     -F client_secret=3456789012 \
     -F redirect_uri=https://example.com/auth/complete
```

4. The response you get back will contain the access token and other information.





```json
{
     "access_token": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
     "token_type": "bearer",
     "expires_in": 7200,
     "refresh_token": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
     "scope": "people",
     "created_at": 1469553476
}
```

5. Use the access token for all API requests by passing it in the `Authorization` header, using the `Bearer` authentication scheme.





```bash
curl https://api.planningcenteronline.com/people/v2/people \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer pco_tok_97df13b9'
```


OAuth access tokens expire after 2 hours from the time they are issued, but we also provide a [refresh token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5) you can use to get a new access token at any time, even after the access token expires, without forcing the user to re-authorize.

We will honor refresh tokens for up to 90 days after the date its associated access token was issued. This means that, if your app does not issue a refresh for 90 days, then your user will need to re-authorize.

[**Application Scopes**](https://developer.planning.center/docs/#/overview/authentication/oauth-2-0#scopes)

Each Planning Center product is a distinct [OAuth scope](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3).

Product

Scope

API

`api`

Calendar

`calendar`

Check-Ins

`check_ins`

Giving

`giving`

Groups

`groups`

People

`people`

Publishing

`publishing`

Registrations

`registrations`

Services

`services`

_Note that accessing Webhooks endpoints do not require an OAuth scope._

Authorization URL is [https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/authorize](https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/authorize) Token URL is [https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/token](https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/token) When authorizing, you can request scopes using the `scope` parameter. The value should be a space-separated list of scopes. The value for `response_type` should be `code`.

[**Refreshing a token**](https://developer.planning.center/docs/#/overview/authentication/oauth-2-0#refreshing-a-token)

You can refresh an expired Oauth token by using the `refresh_token` returned when you generated the token.

```bash
curl -X "POST" "https://api.planningcenteronline.com/oauth/token" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d $'{
    "client_id": "<your application client id>",
    "client_secret": "<your application secret>",
    "refresh_token": "<your access token refresh token>",
    "grant_type": "refresh_token"
  }'
```

The response body will look like this:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<new access token>",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 7200,
  "refresh_token": "<new refresh token>",
  "created_at": 1540325919
}
```
